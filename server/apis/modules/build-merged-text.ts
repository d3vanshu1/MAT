/**
 * Shared utility — builds the merged-text representation used as input to the
 * next tree-reduce round.  Called from:
 *   • merge-findings.ts  (after a live merge)
 *   • load-merge-checkpoints.ts  (to reconstruct stripped text on resume)
 *
 * Keeping this in one place guarantees byte-for-byte parity between fresh
 * merges and checkpoint-resumed merges.
 *
 * ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This produces a LOSSY markdown representation for LLM context only.
 * It is NOT a persistence format. Fields like structured_impact, verification,
 * finding_kind, evidence, severity_anchor, etc. are intentionally omitted because
 * the LLM re-synthesizes them from source text at each merge round.
 *
 * Structured findings are preserved in full via the canonical serializer in
 * save-merge-checkpoint.ts → the `findings` JSONB field retains all metadata.
 * This text representation is merely the input *prompt* for the next merge call.
 *
 * RC1 (canonical-finding): MergedFinding is now an alias for CanonicalFinding.
 * All new code should import CanonicalFinding directly from canonical-finding.ts.
 * This re-export preserves backward compat during the migration.
